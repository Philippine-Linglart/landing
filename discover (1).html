        <h2>What we do</h2>

        <p><strong>We sell volcanoes and lava, but here is a bit more of history:</strong></p>
        <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and
        gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. <br><br>

        On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found
        underwater. For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic
        plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form
        where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells
        Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been
        postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the coreâ€“mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) deep in the Earth.
        This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example. Volcanoes are usually not created where
        two tectonic plates slide past one another.<br><br>

        Cordillera de Apaneca volcanic range in El Salvador. The country is home to 170 volcanoes, 23 which are active,
        including two calderas, one being a supervolcano. El Salvador has earned the epithets endearment La Tierra de Soberbios
        Volcanes, (The Land of Magnificent Volcanoes).<br><br>

        Large eruptions can affect atmospheric temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the Sun and cool the
        Earth's troposphere. Historically, large volcanic eruptions have been followed by volcanic winters which have caused
        catastrophic famines.</p>
